				In order to survive a Trump Presidency, the rise of white nationalism, and widening income inequality, there needs to be a strong resistance.

				Our resistance envisions a future where communities are empowered to create new solutions to present day problems, using direct action, political advocacy, and community development to inspire new people to get involved in politics and to create a united platform for progressive causes.  Portland has an opportunity to become a beacon of light, modeling to the world what a nonviolent resistance movement can truly look like.

				Our movement will endure, gather, and thrive.  Each act of oppression spurs us to recommit our hands and our hearts.  We work, we grow, we change â€” we resist!
