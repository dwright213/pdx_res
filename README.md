### Portland's Resistance
#### Site revision/updates.

#### Brief:
Portland's Resistance's site is currently built on Wix's platform. There's a wide variety of reasons to switch to a custom site set up using one of the popular frameworks, mostly dealing with privacy and usability, but also as a base for possible future web projects.

#### Basic scope of this project:
Regardless of the shortcomings inherent in it's platform, we do currently have a website. So there's no need to rush in rebuilding it, that's a beautiful thing. The current site handles a lot of tasks:

1. Tells visitors who we are and gives bird's eye view of what we're about.
2. Gives info about upcoming events, alongside links to our facebook group, and other social media links.
3. Provides a means of signing up to volunteer, join our mailing list, or contact us.
4. Links to a Gofundme meant to pay for some property damage that occured during a protest

None of these is technically difficult to implement but I would like to create a series of goals to work toward, leading to a site that does what our current Wix setup does, but with potential to be built on to do more. Here's a more detailed version, including the particular resources and and groups I anticipate working with.


1. At it's most basic, a website functions to announce the presence of it's subject, and offer more info about it (the "about" page that most sites have).
I think I would be working with Policy on this one, putting the policy they are working on in the "about" section, along with a means for them to make edits directly to it, without being coders.


2. Visitors to our site are probably curious about what we've got coming up. Upcoming events would be a good way to offer that info, all on one screen. Especially for non-facebook users.
This would require the assistance of DA and whomever handles our social media presence, and there's a lot of ways this can be built. My personal favorite is whichever way would allow our social media folks to get the job done however they are used to doing it. Since we are heavily invested in Facebook that would probably involve using Facebook's API to automatically pull in our events and display them in this section. If folks prefer to use other services like Google Calendars for this, we can work with that, too.


3. Visitors will wish to engage at some level. Having a section devoted to opening contact is crucial.
It will be easy to move the forms we already have on Wix to the new site, but to really build this out would be a bit more complicated. I feel like it's a worthwhile project, but since we have a tool that everyone is used to working with (the Google form) maybe a volunteer/visitor engagement system would be a better left to long-term goals, or features to think about adding once the site is up. Either way, I would like to talk about consolidating our various contact forms, to simplify this communication channel/make it easier for people to reach out.


2. Donations
Do we want to have a donation section for Portland's Resistance in general, or are we only interested in paying for damages from that march a while back? I can keep the current gofundme link, remove it, or put in a link to a different gofundme page. I am unsure of where everyone is at on accepting/asking for donations. Whichever way we go though, having a valid SSL certificate is going to go a long way in making folks feel comfortable making a donation. Demonstrating a good "security culture" (excuse my use of that phrase) in our infrastructure is going to become more and more vital.


### TL;DR

#### Stage 1: Build a site that does everything the current site does, with a few minor changes, including:
- "About" section, where users find our policies, both the high level and full versions.
- A simple, web based interface to enable Policy Workgroup to make edits to the text of our various policies, should need arise.
- An "Upcoming Events" section, that connects to either Facebook's API or a Google calendar, to make the addition of events easy for whoever handles that (DA and/or Social Media?)
- A contact section, ideally with a single form to handle volunteer signups, mailing list signups, and sending messages to Portland's Resistance (details depend on everyone's current workflow).
- Full SSL encryption throughout the site.

#### Stage 2: Deploy.
- Following deployment, be on hand to make quick changes or apply fixes as needed.
- Get input fron Central Committee and the different work groups about what features would be useful for them (a volunteer management system? more social media integration? a live streaming hub? etc..).


#### Stage 3: Build the new features.
- Testing as we go.

#### Stage 4: (See stage 2)
- Wash, rinse, repeat.
